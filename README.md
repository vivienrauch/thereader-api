# **Objective**

My objective with this community app was to bring those who have reading as a hobby closer together;
as well as having a functional app that can authenticate, make it possible for users to follow each other,
make up their own profile, be able to modify it, have some custom features like the book of the month or the book club
events.

## **User Stories**

- [Kanban board] (https://github.com/users/vivienrauch/projects/8/views/1)
- [User stories] (https://github.com/vivienrauch/thereader-api/issues)

All the features are available: https://github.com/vivienrauch/thereader/blob/main/README.md

Testing is available in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
